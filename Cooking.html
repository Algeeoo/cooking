    <h1>Cooking with Daniel from Nada Surf</h1>
    <p>I had a pleasure of spending a crisp, Spring day in Portsmouth, NH cooking and chatting with Daniel Lorca of the 
        brand of the Nada surf as he prepared a gourmet, sit-down dinner for 28 pals.</p>
    <p>When I  first invited Nada Surf to be on the show, I was told that Daniel Lorca was the guy I wanted to talk to.
         Then Daniel emailed his response. “I’m way into it, but I don’t want to talk about it, i wanna do it"<br>
         After years of only having access to touring bands between their sound check set, I’ve been doing a lot of <i>talking</i> about 
         cooking with rockstars.  To actually cook with a band was a dream come true.</p>
    <h2>Six-hour Salad</h2>
   <image src="Salads.jpg"></image>   
   <p>Daniel prepared a salad of arugula, smoked tomatoes, tomato jam, and grilled avocado (it’s as good as it sounds!). 
       I jokingly called it “6-hours salad” because that’s how long he took on it. 
       The fresh tomatoes were slowly smoked over woodchips in the grill, and when they were softened, 
       Daniel separated out the seed s which he reduced into a smoky jam. The tomatoes were cut into stripes to put on the salads. 
       As the day meandered, the avocados finally went on the grill after dark.
       I was on a flashlight duty while Daniel checked for the perfect grill marks.
    </p>
    <p>I wrote up a streamlined adaptation of his recipe that required <i>much</i> less 
        time and serves 6 people instead of <i>five</i>times that amount.
    </p>
        <h2>The Main Course </h2>
    <p>In addition to the smoky grilled salad, Daniel served Tarragon cornish hens with a cognac
             cream sauce loaded with chanterelles and grapes, and 
            wild rice with grilled ramps (wild garlicky leeks). Dinner was served close to midnight, but it was a party so nobody cared.
    </p>
    <p>We left that night (technically, early the next morning) with full bellies, 
        new cooking tips, and early 5 hours of footage. I’m considering renaming the show “cooking with Nada Surf”
